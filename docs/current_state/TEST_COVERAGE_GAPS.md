## Specific Test Cases Needed

1. **Action Parameters Validation:** Test that action parameters are properly validated against their schema definitions.

2. **Conditional Conversation Prompts:** Test that prompts with conditions are correctly filtered based on resource state.

3. **Resource Relationship Navigation:** Test that relationships can be traversed through the explore functionality.

4. **Collection Filtering:** Test that collections can be filtered by various criteria and return correct results.

5. **State Machine Transitions:** Test complex state machine scenarios, including invalid transitions.

6. **Error Recovery Suggestions:** Test that errors include appropriate recovery suggestions as described in the white paper.

7. **Multi-Modal Resource Handling:** Test resources with image and audio properties.

8. **Collection Aggregates:** Test that collection-level statistics are computed correctly.

9. **Adaptive Representation:** Test that resources adapt their representation based on context.

10. **Collaborative Resource Access:** Test multi-user scenarios with role-based permissions.

## New Test Strategies Needed

1. **Protocol Compatibility Tests:** Validate compatibility with different LLM protocols.

2. **Resource Schema Validation:** Test resources against their schema definitions.

3. **User Experience Tests:** Assess conversational flow using simulated LLM interactions.

4. **Performance Benchmarks:** Establish baseline performance metrics for key operations.

5. **Security Tests:** Validate authorization, action permissions, and data isolation.

6. **Serialization Consistency:** Ensure resources serialize consistently across different operations.
