    *   Domain-driven design for core entities

1.  **`CognitiveStore` Core:**
    *   CRUD operations (`create`, `get`, `update`, `delete`) interacting with Deno KV.
    *   Collection retrieval (`getCollection`) with basic filtering (equality) and pagination.
    *   Action execution (`performAction`) handling default `update`/`delete` actions and basic custom action flow.
2.  **`CognitiveResource` Structure:**
    *   Basic properties storage.
    *   Action definitions (`Action` interface).
    *   HATEOAS Links (`Link` interface, `addLink`, `getLinks`, `getLink`, automatic `self` link).
    *   Presentation Hints (`PresentationHints`, `setPresentation`).
    *   Conversation Prompts (`ConversationPrompt`, `addPrompt`, `getPrompts`).
    *   `toJSON()` serialization (outputting keys without internal underscores).
3.  **`CognitiveCollection` Structure:**
    *   Holds items, item type, pagination info, applied filters.
    *   Basic collection-level actions (`create`, `filter`).
    *   `toJSON()` serialization.
4.  **`StateMachine`:**
    *   Definition (`StateDefinition`, `TransitionDefinition`, `StateMachineDefinition`).
    *   Core logic (`StateMachine` class: `getInitialState`, `getStateDefinition`, `isActionAllowed`, `getTargetState`, `getAllowedActions`).
5.  **State Machine Integration:**
    *   `CognitiveStore.registerStateMachine`.
    *   `create`: Sets initial resource `status` based on registered SM.
    *   `enhanceResource`: Adds state info (`_stateName`, `_stateDescription`), state-specific actions, presentation hints, and prompts based on current `status`.
    *   `performAction`: Checks if an action is allowed in the current state (temporary bypass for update/delete) and updates the `status` property upon successful transition.
6.  **Resource Enhancement (`enhanceResource`):**
    *   Adds default actions (`update`, `delete`) if not overridden by state.
    *   Adds state-based info/actions/hints/prompts (using 'task' example).
    *   Adds relationship links based on `*Id` property naming convention.
7.  **Protocol Adapter Pattern:**
    *   Defined `IProtocolAdapter` interface in `src/adapters/protocol/protocol_adapter.ts`
    *   Implemented protocol-agnostic `CognitiveBridge` that works with any protocol adapter
    *   Created `McpProtocolAdapter` implementing the interface specifically for MCP protocol
    *   Added `ProtocolFactory` for creating different protocol adapters
    *   Made protocol calls standardized through `explore()`, `act()`, and `create()` methods
    *   Implemented error handling and response formatting for each protocol
    *   Full test coverage for the bridge with mock components
    *   Moved protocol implementations out of infrastructure for better separation of concerns
8.  **Basic HTTP Server (`src/main.ts`):**
    *   Uses `Deno.serve` to listen for requests.
    *   Initializes Store and Bridge, registers sample state machine.
    *   Routes requests based on HTTP Method and Path (`GET /type/id`, `GET /type`, `POST /type`, `POST /type/id/action`) to appropriate bridge handlers.
    *   Parses JSON request bodies for `POST`.
    *   Constructs JSON `Response` objects based on protocol responses.
9.  **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for `CognitiveStore` covering CRUD, collections, state integration, enhancements.
    *   Unit tests for `StateMachine`.
    *   Unit tests for protocol adapter implementations and bridge.
10. **Strict State Action Checking:**
    *   `performAction` now strictly enforces that an action (including `update`/`delete`) must be present in the current state's `allowedActions` if a state machine is registered.
11. **Storage Adapter Pattern:**
    *   Defined `IStorageAdapter` interface in `src/store/storage_adapter.ts`
    *   Refactored `CognitiveStore` to be storage-agnostic, accepting any adapter implementing the interface
    *   Moved Deno KV implementation to `adapters/deno/kv_adapter.ts`
    *   Updated tests to use the adapter pattern
    *   Made the framework core independent of specific storage technologies
