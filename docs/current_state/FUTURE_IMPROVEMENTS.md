# ðŸš€ Future Improvements

1.  **Advanced Collection Queries:** Implement more complex filtering (operators like `gt`, `lt`, `contains`, `startsWith`), sorting (by arbitrary fields), and potentially field selection in `getCollection` and expose via MCP bridge query parameters.
2.  **Schema Validation:** Implement schema definitions for resource types (e.g., using Zod) and validate payloads in `create`/`update`/`performAction`.
3.  **Sophisticated Enhancement:** Drive resource enhancement (links, hints, prompts) from schemas/configuration rather than hardcoded logic or simple conventions.
4.  **Real MCP Integration:** Replace simplified MCP types/flow with actual MCP SDK integration if targeting MCP compatibility specifically.
5.  **Authentication/Authorization:** Add a layer to control access to resources and actions.
6.  **Real-time Updates:** Explore WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing updates to clients.
7.  **Hypermedia Controls:** Ensure `Link` and `Action` definitions fully align with chosen hypermedia formats (like HAL, Siren, Collection+JSON).
8.  **Deployment:** Containerization, configuration management for deployment.
9.  ~~Create a separation layer for store agnosticism so that we can easily replace the store on demand without too much hassle.~~ âœ… IMPLEMENTED

## Storage Adapter Improvements

10. **Additional Storage Adapters:** Implement adapters for popular databases:
    - SQL Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    - Document Databases (MongoDB)
    - Redis
    - LocalStorage (for browser environments)
    
11. **Adapter Factory:** Create a factory pattern for adapter instantiation based on configuration.
    ```typescript
    // Example usage:
    const adapter = StorageAdapterFactory.create({
      type: "postgres",
      connectionString: "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
    });
    ```

12. **Performance Optimizations:** Add specialized methods to the adapter interface for:
    - Batch operations (createMany, updateMany, deleteMany)
    - Transactions
    - Indexing and query optimization

13. **Caching Layer:** Implement a caching decorator for adapters to improve read performance:
    ```typescript
    const baseAdapter = new PostgresAdapter(config);
    const adapter = new CachingAdapterDecorator(baseAdapter, cacheConfig);
    ```

14. **Mock Adapter:** Create a fully in-memory adapter for tests that doesn't require external dependencies.

15. **Migration Tools:** Develop utilities to migrate data between different storage backends.
